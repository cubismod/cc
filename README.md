Installation
==

1. Create a folder titled "cc" in your steamapps/sourcemods folder.

3. Exit and restart Steam.
4. Launch new "Cloned Cube" mod icon in your Steam library.
5. Play!

Important to note about Github Installation
==

Due to the nature of Source Mods, if you want to clone the repository, you **must** choose the "sourcemods" folder of your Steam directory. A folder called "cc" will be created. Make sure not to rename the folder to another name as that will break some localization in titles within the mod. If you want to install a released zip version from our ModDB or other site, delete the repository and just extract the "cc" folder back into your "sourcemods" folder.

How to Play
==

You can load the map "cc_1" in the "New Game" menu of the mod and selecting "Escape"
You can load the map "training1" by launching the console "~ key" and typing "map training1"
